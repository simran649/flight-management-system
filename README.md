# flight-management-system
This was created for a school project (Class 12th) for the boards and written in Python and SQL.

Written with basic knowledge of Python, SQL, and mysqlconnector. It was my first project. So there could be some problems in it. Learnt a lot from this about both languages. 
I took the main code of this project from Google. At that time, I didn't know anything about the process of making projects in Python. The original file had about 50 to 80 lines of code, and the code didn't work. 
I worked with these 50 to 80 lines of code and made them up to 485 lines. I researched about each and everything in it, and how to implement it as well. And finished this in about a week.
